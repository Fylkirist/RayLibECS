1. Collision Detection and physics for 2D rigid and soft bodies

2. Make a small game as PoC

3. Object loader -> entity initialization from game files

4. 3D collision detection and physics

5. Map textures to bodies (either have the physical objects also be visual representations, or create new visual component attached to entities)
